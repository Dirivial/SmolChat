# SmolChat

A very small chat application made with Linux sockets for communication &
ncurses for drawing UI.

The goal is to practice sending/receiving information through sockets,
a bit of multithreading, learning ncurses and handling signals.

Also, I haven't written a lot of C++ code so I wanted to get familiar with
a couple of the stuff it has to offer. Still, I'd say that most of the code is
fairly C-like.

I have split the chat application into two major parts, the server and the client.

TODO: Add a short video on how the program works
